DECISION: Send for review.

The paper addresses a timely question -- whether the widely discussed divergence between stock prices and job postings reflects AI displacement -- using Swedish microdata and a difference-in-differences design that exploits the seven-month gap between Riksbanken's first rate hike and the ChatGPT launch. The null finding for AI-driven displacement, combined with a significant monetary policy channel, is a useful addition to the rapidly growing literature following Brynjolfsson, Chandar, and Chen (2025). The paper is concise, the identification is transparent, and the policy relevance is immediate. I recommend sending it to two referees, though several concerns should be addressed.

NOVELTY ASSESSMENT

The paper offers a genuinely new angle. While Kauhanen and Rouvinen (2025, 2026) tested the "canaries" hypothesis using Finnish employment data, this is the first study to decompose the posting decline itself by AI exposure -- which is the relevant margin, since the "scary chart" debate is about postings. The timing identification using the Riksbanken rate hike as a pre-ChatGPT shock is clever and provides a cleaner separation of monetary versus AI effects than is available in the US data. The contribution is incremental but clearly stated, and Economics Letters is the right venue for this kind of focused empirical note.

FIT FOR ECONOMICS LETTERS

The paper fits the journal's format well. It is tightly written, stays within the word limit, and presents a single clean result. The two main figures are effective and the regression table is parsimonious. The online appendix with seven robustness checks is appropriate. One concern: the paper currently references an online appendix and event study figure that should be made available to referees.

POTENTIAL CONCERNS

1. Identification. The core design compares high- vs. low-AI-exposure occupations before and after two events. But the parallel trends assumption is not formally tested in the main text. The event study (appendix Figure A3) shows noisy pre-trends with considerable fluctuation, which a referee will flag. The confidence bands are wide enough that meaningful differential effects could be hiding in the noise.

2. Robustness sensitivity. In two robustness specifications (all-apps measure, terciles), the ChatGPT coefficient becomes statistically significant at the 5% level. The paper mentions these only in passing. A referee will reasonably ask whether the null result is robust or fragile, and why different exposure measures produce different conclusions.

3. External validity of Platsbanken. The paper does not discuss coverage. Platsbanken is the PES job bank; private-sector employers increasingly post on LinkedIn, Indeed, and other platforms. If AI-exposed occupations (e.g., white-collar, professional) are disproportionately posted elsewhere, the sample may undercount precisely the occupations where AI effects would appear. This selection issue needs at least a paragraph of discussion.

4. Power. With 369 occupations and occupation-level clustering, the effective sample size for the DiD interaction is modest. A power calculation or discussion of minimum detectable effects would strengthen the paper.

5. The DAIOE index is the authors' own measure. Referees may ask for replication using an independent exposure index (Felten et al. or Webb) to address concerns about circularity.

SUGGESTED REVIEWERS

I recommend two referees: (1) a labour economist working on AI and automation exposure, ideally someone familiar with European vacancy data or the task-based framework; (2) a macroeconomist or applied microeconomist with expertise in monetary policy transmission to labour markets, who can assess whether the timing identification is sufficient to separate the two channels.
